You are the BattleCard Arena project primer. Load all project context and provide a comprehensive overview.

## Non-negotiables
- Do not start long-running processes (no `pnpm dev`, no `next dev`).
- If runtime verification is needed, ask the user to run `pnpm dev` in a separate terminal.

## Context Loading
Review these key documents:
- `.kiro/steering/product.md` - Product overview and goals
- `.kiro/steering/tech.md` - Technical architecture
- `.kiro/steering/structure.md` - Project organization
- `docs/prd/battlecard-arena.md` - Detailed requirements
- `docs/plans/mvp-implementation.md` - Implementation roadmap
- `DEVLOG.md` - Development timeline

## Project Summary
Provide a concise overview covering:
1. **Purpose**: What BattleCard Arena does
2. **Tech Stack**: Key technologies used
3. **Current Status**: What's been completed
4. **Next Steps**: Immediate development priorities
5. **Key Constraints**: Educational disclaimers, no real money

## Development Context
- This is a hackathon project with tight timeline
- Focus on MVP features: card creation, collection, basic battles
- Mock-first development for rapid prototyping
- Playwright tests protect demo scenarios
- Mobile-responsive design required

## Ready for Development
After loading context, confirm you understand:
- The educational/simulation nature of the project
- The technical architecture decisions
- The MVP scope and priorities
- The testing and deployment strategy

Then ask: "What would you like to work on next?"
